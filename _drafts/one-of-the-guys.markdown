title: Are you "one of the guys"?

People often talk about a girl being "one of the guys." It's often a point of pride for a girl to say she's "just one of the guys."

Guys will also grant admittance to this exclusive club themselves, referring to a girl as "one of the guys."

I loathe this phrase.

The other night, I was out with three other women. The conversation drifted towards talking about how tech is male-dominated. One by one, these three other women affirmed they "have always been one of the guys."

Internally, I felt discouraged because I have never been one of the guys, and I never will be. Will I fit in to this tech landscape then?

Yes, yes. Tech is actively working to make women feel welcome, and to encourage women to make up for the skills they never pursued in high school due to different societal pressures and expectations. That's wonderful.

But do I have to be a girl who's "one of the guys" to be able to join?

About a year ago, a highly revered figure in the NEO tech arena gave a talk on women in tech. I was very encouraged throughout the talk as we learned about how so many foundational computer science discoveries were worked on by women. Why had I never heard of these brilliant, driven women!

But then, at the end, the presenter summarized the current tech arena. She said it's hard to make it as a woman. She said that's never been a problem for her though. She fits in because she has always been "one of the guys." Immediately my bubble of hope deflated.

I'm not "one of the guys." I guess I don't belong.

I have a friend who has always been "one of the guys." I married one of the guys from her club. She eventually married another. It's actually quite perfect, in terms of friendships, because we all still hang out despite being in different states.

But I have also been told at different points by the men in the group -- yes, my husband included -- that I won't understand X like my friend will, because she's always been "one of the guys" and I just don't have what it takes.

My husband's words were something like, "It's hard to explain why, but [friend] has always been one of the guys. You wouldn't be because you're just not that type of person. I can't say why exactly."

As most people do when they learn new information, he has since come to realize the error of his thinking. And not just because of the vitriolic way in which I explained to him all the ways that mentality is harmful and just plain fucking sucks.

One of the other guys has a grad degree in some psych discipline, and he had never even heard of Heidi/Howard. What are they teaching kids these days?

You know why this mentality is especially bad?

Because it's a badge of honor for a girl to be "one of the guys."

Because it's a title you can be deemed worthy of.

Because it's something other people ascribe to you, not a skill you can improve on.

Because it's not a fucking skill, it's a societal construct.

Oh, and -- because it's not true the other way around.

When's the last time you heard a man brag about how he's just "one of the girls?" How many men do you know would be proud to included in the girls' group, exclusive to other men in his social circle? How many women do you know of who talk in glowing ways about a man who's "one of the girls"?

One male friend of mine confided in me once that he's always had more, and deeper, friendships with girls. He doesn't know why, but when he has social parties at his house, women make up the majority of the guest list.

He asked me why I thought this was. For a moment, there was a tinge of ... regret? in his voice.

What was wrong with him that made it easier for him to get along with men than women?

And **that** is what is wrong with this mentality.

Strong, capable women brag about how they get along better with men than with women. Strong, capable men woner what's wrong with them if they get along better with women than with men.

Full circle: *the tech industry.*

This exists in _the tech industry_, but it isn't exclusive to _the tech industry_, nor is it _the tech industry's_ fault. It's a societal thing.

It's a mentality anyone in a male-dominated industry needs to be aware of, so they don't accidentally encourage it.

I've been reminded of this as I recently started my first job in the field of software engineering. I should probably write a post about how awesome it felt to achieve this goal! I'm in way over my head and learning so much. It's great.

This new job, though, has emphasized how ingrained this problem is.

My company and the people I work with are amazing. My coworkers were insanely welcoming when I started. I was overwhelmed by the number of people who made it a point to come to my desk and welcome me to the team. I have never once been intentionally made to feel unwelcome, and I don't foresee that happening.

But there's this whole **subconscious** thing; my inner battles of feeling like I don't belong.

I'm starting to understand why women leave the tech industry. I'm in an crazy supportive environment, and I _still_ feel like I don't belong because I don't know enough, because I'm not a dude, and because I'm not a girl who can be "one of the guys." It's hard enough to fight your inner battles when people around you are building you up.

I'm thankful for AkronWiT and the community I have. I'm thankful for my job and the people I work with. I'm thankful for the strong women in my life and how we can learn from and encourage each other. I'm thankful for being in a career I get excited about every day.

Now if we -- women and men -- could just banish "one of the guys" from our vocabulary, I'd start to actually believe I belong here.
