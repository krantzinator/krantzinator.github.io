title: I shouldn't feel this way
category: blog

I'm part of a group of organizers for a thing (deliberately vague).

For this thing, we are going to have t-shirts. While making decisions for said t-shirts, one of the guys said, "The quote from [person] only has unisex. I am fine if we are only doing that. But I need to know before [other organizing things]"

I stepped in with, "i will not be fine if we only do unisex."

I then thought, "Oh now I'm the thorn in people's side, being all annoying with wanting women to have t-shirts too. Better try to act nice." So then I offered to cover t-shirt costs if money was an issue.

UGH. Why?!

I shouldn't feel that I am annoying people when I ask for something as basic as providing t-shirts for everyone who attends an event.

I shouldn't feel that I have to "act nice."

I shouldn't feel like an outsider.

But now I do. And it's frustrating as all get out.

And I can just see the people who would pat me on the head, saying, "There there you oversensitive little girl. Silly girl. It's not a big deal that someone doesn't think women's tshirts are important. It's just a tshirt. You're so sensitive."

To those people -- run some searches on things like "gender backlash ghostbusters" or "gender backlash star wars rogue one" or "gender backlash new oceans movie." Dude bros get hella pissed when they are not represented. So go sit down.

Back to what my brain has processed in the ~hour since this happened: at first I was sad. I felt like I wasn't part of this group, of even this event I'm helping to organize, because something that I could use was so flippantly disregarded. Not important.

I came up with a bunch of reasons why the guy who said this didn't mean anything by it, why it's not a big deal, why he wasn't intentionally trying to exclude a specific demographic.

But I shouldn't feel like I have to defend the intent of people's actions, and thereby disregard the message I receive from them. I shouldn't feel like I don't belong. And that's why things as "silly" as t-shirts are actually a big deal. If you tell people they don't belong by not providing swag for them, by having people in your logos and stickers not look like them, by using language without thinking about it that oh-so-casually excludes them -- guess what? They won't come. They'll get the message.

I said a lot more things in my head about this, but I can't remember them. I was sad, then mad, and probably went through a very rapid 5-stages-of-grief thing.

So there's my brain-dump. Messaging is important. Therefore all the things we use for messaging are important -- our words, our logos, our swag. It ALL matters.

For myself, I shouldn't feel guilty for speaking up for a disenfranchised demographic.
