Abstractions was a unique event. If you run conferences, take the next few minutes to skim down these pictures and get some inspiration for what your conference *could* be. Borrow one idea, and see what kind of difference it makes.

If you don't want to skim, here's what they did in one sentence:

**Everything about and around Abstractions had the goal of fostering community and collaboration**

I didn't even realize the extent of this until I gave a short presentation at Akron Code Club about how awesome Abstractions was. As I flipped through screenshots of tweets, this theme kept coming up. Active creation of collaboration.

Powerful stuff.

For the skimmers out there, here's how they did it.

**From the start, Abstractions focused on quality**
The attention they put into their branding was noticeable. Here's their signature artwork, as displayed on their site:

**They didn't keep this design to themselves. Organizers invited attendees to take an active part in individual design elements.**

**Their badges were of such high quality, it inspired people to take pictures. The organizers then turned it into a contest to involve more people, and it worked.**

**Their swag bag gave you a schedule of outside events -- actively encouraging and allowing for interaction outside of the scheduled talks -- and a LEGO.**

**Their attention to detail and quality attracted people from around the country and the world**

**Outside activities included the world premiere of "What Comes Next Is the Future" PLUS a panel with several creators. Again, not stopping at just an event, but involving people in the event.**

**Their scholarship program covered ~55 people who otherwise couldn't have attended.**

**They involved their host city. Next Pittsburgh, one of the primary tourism organizations in Pittsburgh, gave them a microsite.**

**The airport even got in on the action**

**Oh yeah, and they had daycare**

**They not only brought in amazing, well-known speakers, but they then gave attendees the opporrunity to meet those people.**

**Oh yeah, and those well-known speakers also got to meet each other. Did you know Larry Wahl (inventor of Perl) and Joe Armstrong (inventor of Erlang) had never met before? Well, now they have.**
[tweet]

**They had a whole segment of talks called Distractions, focused on hands-on work that got people moving and interacting.**
[tweets]

**If you had work you needed to do during the conference -- it was three days -- they had you covered there, too.**
[tweet]

**After-talk events included karaoke, Pittsburgh GDI's *Code & Coffee* event, a rendition of the *Just a Minute* game show, a speaker dinner complete with spontaneous fireworks because Pittsburgh is awesome, board game night, and organized groups for a Steelers game, Carnegie Science Museum tour, and a Pirates game.**

**Here's an example of how their focus on conversation, collaboration, and interaction resulted in attendees taking impactful actions:**

All in all, this is much too big to be a yearly event. But they may be able to make it an every-other-year kind of thing. Barring that, they keep tweeting about how they are working on something new. I signed up for those alerts the first time I saw the tweets, and now the continuing tweets are driving me crazy with anticipation of what's going to come next.

Abstractions made me miss Pittsburgh. It also inspired me for what our industry could look like. 1500 people don't tweet madly over three days about how awesome something is if the principles behind it don't mean something.

The trending words in this article are: *active, collaboration,* and *community.* I like those words. Let's use them more in our conferences and our industry.
