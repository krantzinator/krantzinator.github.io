          <p>My story with PyOhio is one of amazement at how lovely people can be. It’s a big part of the reason Python is and forever will be my favorite programming language.</p>

<p>For PyOhio 2015, I signed up to volunteer, but was unable to afford the drive down to Columbus. I sent out a request on Twitter, and luckily have one friend who is quite spontaneous and decided she would like to to go to PyOhio in a couple of days, too.</p>

<p>This same friend joined me again this year, and brought another mutual friend of ours. Included in our posse were two other women I had specifically invited, causing me to feel pretty proud at this group of people who came either directly or indirectly because of me.</p>

<p>On to what you all missed by not being at PyOhio 2016!</p>

<p>Hands down, my favorite talk of the weekend was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iU9FM9qnEjk">Small Batch Artisanal Bots: Let’s Make Friends</a> by Elizabeth Uselton. Her PyOhio video isn’t up (yet?), but you can watch the shorter version from this year’s PyCon by following that link. I took so many notes, and jotted down so many ideas for projects to build. The biggest thing I got out of her talk was:</p>

<p><strong>Intermediate learn-to-coders live in a resource desert. Bots are a great way for the post-beginner to get practice building small applications, and they can grow in complexity. With the lack of intermediate resources, maybe I should create some.</strong></p>

<p>I’d like this blog to be more <em>useful</em> to the teach-yourself-to-code community. This is a great motivation for how I can do that. I can build things too advanced for the tutorial-leaning beginner, and share those experiences and learnings here for other intermediate learn-to-coders.</p>

<p>Moving on! Two other honorable mentions on the talks circuit are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtyik4DePVY&amp;list=PL2k6bbM_wgju204mCEyw3bmDH62dp_sLu&amp;index=15">Python Logging: An Introduction to Silent Failures</a> by Jess Unrein, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbtMucm1qAg&amp;list=PL2k6bbM_wgju204mCEyw3bmDH62dp_sLu&amp;index=3">An Introduction to Recursion</a> by Rinita Gulliani. Unrein’s talk was largely new information for me, and Gulliani presented a clearer way of approaching a programming concept that I understand but am curious to understand <strong>better</strong> and at a deeper level.</p>

<p>Aside from the ideas I formed out of Uselton’s talk on bots, I got another big benefit from this year’s PyOhio.</p>

<p>I realized that the beginner topics were too beginner for me. I was beyond most of the information presented in them. It was very exciting for me to recognize I’m progressing in my knowledge and skill level.</p>

<p>I’ve got to tell you, I was EXHAUSTED by the time Sunday afternoon rolled around. But any  time I walk away from something with more ideas than I know what to do with, I’ll say exhaustion is a worthy price to pay.</p>

<p>Speaking of paying, did you know PyOhio is free? I also did a crazy thing and volunteered to help organize next year. You’ll be hearing even more from me then about how you really should give PyOhio a weekend of your time.</p>

<p>Allow me to share one more experience that stands out, and then I’ll let you go. Catherine Devlin is the founding person behind PyOhio. I assume she has many friends in the PyOhio community, and knows a great many “important” people. And yet, come lunch time, she was looking around for lunch partners and I invited her to join my group. I’m impressed when people who have a lot of influence in a certain community are still in touch with that same community in an honest way, rather than getting too important for the people in it. I see the true spirit of python and PyOhio in how she went into lunch without pre-made plans to eat with people she already knew, and instead readily sat down with strangers.</p>

<p>We are all here trying to learn new things and connect with new people and share ideas. That’s why I love this conference!</p>
