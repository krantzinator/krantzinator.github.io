title: I'll help you write a conference talk

I offered this on a whim on Twitter. Here's my equally thought-out blog post with more details.

Are you terrified of giving a tech talk?

If you have less than 3 years of programming experience, and/or are a coding newbie, I want to help you write a one. It can be for a local tech Meetup or for submitting to conferences. I don't care where you give it, I just want more beginner-types giving more talks.

Here's my offer. I will help with:
- brainstorming topics
- writing your proposal
- rehearsing your talk and giving feedback

The actual writing of the talk will be up to you, but I'll be there for questions and support every step of the way. I'm not an expert, but I'm pretty good at public speaking (not going to sell myself short - lesson number one!). You can see my list of talks I've given [here](http://rachelkrantz.com/talks/) for examples. (Not listed: my talk on Apprenticeships at Abstractions in Pittsburgh, August 2016).

DM me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rustbeltrachel). Looking forward to it.
