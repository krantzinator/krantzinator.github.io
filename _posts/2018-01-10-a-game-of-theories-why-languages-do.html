    <p>I gave this talk at CodeMash in Sandusky, OH, and then again at
        Software GR in Grand Rapids, MI.
    </p>
    <p>
      My talk summary:
      <p>
      <em>How often do you search for “how to do [x] in [language]”? 
      Maybe you’re a Python developer who thinks Go’s dedication to 
      clean syntax feels familiar, or maybe you’re a Ruby dev who 
      thinks Erlang’s pattern matching doesn’t leave enough freedom 
      in your code to deal. Language differences and similarities both 
      enamor and infuriate us, but much as we love to debate otherwise,
      no language is 100% evil or 100% good. There are reasons and background
      stories for why they do what they do. So let’s compare how they solve our 
      common problems. What does a language’s built-in-functions tell
      us about why they were created and how they are best used? 
      Language list: Ruby, Python, Go, Erlang, Clojure, JavaScript</em>
