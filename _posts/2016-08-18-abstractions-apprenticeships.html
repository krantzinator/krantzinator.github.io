    <p>I gave a talk at Abstractions in Pittsburgh, PA
        making the case for apprenticeships in the tech industry.</p>
    <p>
        From the <a href="http://abstractions.io/">Abstractions</a> website:
        <p>
        <em>"Abstractions is a new conference that brings together everyone involved
         in modern software development — designers, developers, DevOps, and
         community leaders — to teach, learn, and connect."</em>
         </p>

        My talk summary:
        <p>
        <em>Our culture’s workforce defaults to internships, which have a
            reputation for being short-term, involving lots of coffee runs,
            and are usually limited to college students. With the changes in
            both the tech and college industries -- more people without CS
            degrees pursuing careers in tech -- what if we brought back the
            apprenticeship model? In this talk, we will examine what
            apprenticeships have historically been, why we shifted to the
            internship model, and what we can gain by adding apprenticeships
            back into our normal work environments -- especially in our
            industry. I will share both historical research and present-day
            case studies. You will leave equipped with the base knowledge you
            need to implement apprenticeships at your own company, and you will
            know how to get the most value out of an apprenticeship as either a
            company or an apprentice.</em>
